# thesis_project
The code in StrConsSolver.java implements the solver for string constraints defined in chapter 3 of the thesis report.
Files sat[1-14].txt and unsat[1-7].txt are the test files for the solver. 
Functions in Z3benchmarks.java with corresponding names to test files represent the formulas contained in the files when they are provided to Z3str solver.
